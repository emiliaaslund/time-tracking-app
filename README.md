## How to Start: 


### CSS: 
- Material UI & Material Icons: 

First time trying Material UI, I wanted to learn something new. 

It's simple, easy to use, fast and developed for mobile-first. 
It saves me a lot of time for styling so I can focus on the functionality without compromising the design. 

### Npm Packages: 

- React Router Dom
- Axios: My preferred way to make API-requests. 
- Json-Server: Perfectt to use when you need a fake backend.
