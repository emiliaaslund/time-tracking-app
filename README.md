# time-tracking-app

## How to Start & Use:

npm install
npm install -g json-server
npm run dev
npm run backend

### Styling:

- Material UI, Material Icons, Datepicker

First time trying Material UI, because I wanted to try something new. It's was fun but tricky!
I usually write vanilla CSS / or use Bootstrap but Material UI seemed like a good choice when we were going to make a mobile-first app.
It's very minimalistic now, maybe I will add more styling and colors in the future.

### Npm Packages:

- React Router Dom
- Axios: My preferred way to make API-requests.
- Json-Server: Perfect to use when you need a fake backend.
- Dayjs: I wanted to try after our teacher talked about it in class.
- uuid: to easy generate id.
